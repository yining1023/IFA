                <p class="heading">Display Cases in the Great Hall</p>
                <p class="content">Responding to the contained space found within two empty glass library cases on the staircase in the Great Hall, independent curator Lisa A. Banner (IFA, PhD 2006) has come up with a series of intimate exhibitions of conceptual work by contemporary artists.  &ldquo;Unrealized installations&rdquo; allows for artists to explore how the space might be filled with a series of ideas, or a concentrated exploration of a single idea, seen through transparent glass, as viewers climb between two floors.</p>
          <p class="content">The series features the work of conceptual artists in many forms. Using different media, like photography, drawing, and sculpture, they compose work designed to engage a viewer within an enclosed transparent space, seen through glass, at different angles. In deference to the library setting, some engage writing, books or the printed page in their work.</p>
          <p class="content">The first exhibition, &ldquo;Flowers of the Sky&rdquo; (until October 31st) features painted book pages created by William Smith, who used a deconstructed 18th century astronomy treatise as the paper support for luscious botanical paintings in oil paint. </p>
          <p class="content">New York artist Christopher Smith considered the space within Duke House itself, in relation to the cases. He created a sets of photographs named &ldquo;Alabaster and Albacore,&rdquo; with images that combine the soaring space of the Great Hall staircase with flowing colors and exploding bubbles, merging images of the still interior architecture with moving and dripping paint.  The exhibition opens on 1 November 2013, and runs to 17 January 2014.</p>
          <p class="content">In the spring months, Jongil Ma, an internationally recognized Korean sculptor and installation artist, will respond with a maquette of one of his monumental wooden installations, paired with a sculpture in mirrors, specifically designed for the space, to reflect the peering visitor&rsquo;s own face, and offer reflection.</p>
                <p class="content">Among the artists who have agreed to create or show work in the space in spring, are Irish artist Timothy Hawkesworth and Colombian artist Eliana Pérez.  Hawkesworth will present &ldquo;Wishes,&rdquo; a series of small paintings of horses in motion, and Pérez, whose collaborative artist book &ldquo;Thorn,&rdquo; has just been acquired by the Library of Congress, will present a series of delicate watercolor drawings, designed as &ldquo;furnishings&rdquo; specifically for this special library setting.  Future contributors include Beatrice Pediconi, whose work is currently being shown at the Collezione Maramotti in Reggio Emilia.              </p>

              <p class="headingBROCHURE"><span class="italic">Flowers of the Sky</span></p>
              <p class="content"><span class="italic">Flowers of the Sky</span>&nbsp;is a series of life-size botanical paintings on the folios of an 18th century astronomy text, dismantled and then reassembled into an accordion-fold artist book. The transformation of the text of James Ferguson's&nbsp;<span class="italic">Astronomy</span>&nbsp;<span class="italic">Explained upon Sir Isaac Newton’s Principles </span>(1799) began in response to a Victorian astronomy book entitled&nbsp;<span class="italic">Flowers of the Sky</span>&nbsp;in the archive of the John Work Garrett Library at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
              <p class="content">As the artist describes, the fluid yet tenuous painting on the book pages is analogous to a fragile web or distant constellation. For Smith, flowers are symbols of our selves and of nature, as well as a metaphor for the machinations of the universe. Implicitly, book folios serve as multivalent supports for the painted leaves and flowers that adorn them with color and design imposed over printed words.</p>
              <p class="content">In the works on view with&nbsp;<span class="italic">Flowers of the Sky</span>, William Smith manipulates the intimate setting of a book page, a small-scale print or piece of paper, and approaches landscape as a response to the pages and their text, or the words found there. At times he reveals and at times obscures the words on the page. His visual language consists of representations of reflection, dissolving surfaces, hidden meaning, and impenetrability. &nbsp;Combining this language with the eloquence of a natural landscape, Smith reflects the tensions between ordered and &nbsp;accidental marks, or the absence of human presence with the implicit sense of human touch in a painted surface.</p>
