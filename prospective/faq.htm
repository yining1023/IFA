                <p class="content"><span class="strong">Frequently Asked Questions</span><br>
                  <br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: What programs of study are offered by the IFA?</span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A:</span> We offer the following programs:<br>
                  - Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy in the History of Art and Archaeology;<br>
                  - Dual Master of Arts in the History of Art and Archaeology and MS in the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works;<br>
                  - Advanced Certificate in Curatorial Studies offered jointly with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, offered only to students in the doctoral program.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: Does the IFA offer a studio arts program?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A:</span> We do not, but NYU offers several graduate studio arts degree programs through the Steinhardt School of Education: <a href="mailto:steinhardt.gradadmissions@nyu.edu">steinhardt.gradadmissions@nyu.edu</a>.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: Does the IFA offer a museum studies program?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>We offer a doctoral-level Curatorial Studies Certificate program. NYU also offers a museum studies degree program through the Graduate School of Arts and Science:<a href="mailto:museum.studies@nyu.edu"> museum.studies@nyu.edu</a>.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: May I take courses for credit at the IFA without being enrolled in a degree program?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>We do not have non-matriculated student status. To take courses at the IFA, you must be pursuing a graduate degree at NYU or be a Visiting Student from another university's graduate art history program as part of the inter-university doctoral consortium. <br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: May I audit courses at the IFA?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A:</span> Auditing opportunities are available via the <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/support/connoisseurs.htm">Connoisseurs Circle</a>.  For further information, please contact Andrea Yglesias: <a href="mailto:andrea.yglesias@nyu.edu">andrea.yglesias@nyu.edu</a>.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: How long does it take to complete the programs offered by the IFA?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A:</span> That depends upon which program:<br>
                  - The M.A. program takes two years for full-time students or three years for part time;<br>
                  - The Conservation program, which combines the M.A. in art history with specific conservation courses and a year-long internship, takes a total of four years;<br>
                  - The PhD program is designed for six years of full-time, fully-funded study;<br>
                  - The Curatorial Studies Certificate adds a year-long internship to the doctoral program.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: How many students are enrolled in the programs at the IFA?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>There are about 300 students actively pursuing the various degree and certificate programs at the IFA.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: What academic preparation is required for admission to the IFA?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>The Bachelor of Arts degree from an accredited American university or an equivalent degree from a foreign university is required of all applicants. Please refer to the Admission Requirements for each program’s specific prerequisites.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: What languages are required to study at the IFA?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>The ability to translate a foreign language, with the use of dictionary, is required for all degrees. M.A. students can choose to be tested in French, German or Italian. PhD students will be tested in two modern languages of their choosing. <br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: If I already have an MA in art history, does the admissions process differ?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>Applicants with an M.A. in art history must include their thesis or another substantial writing sample with their PhD application and should make contact with an IFA faculty member appropriate to their intended area of doctoral study.<br>
                  Those interested in the conservation program and have obtained an M.A. elsewhere should contact<a href="mailto:conservation.program@nyu.edu"> conservation.program@nyu.edu</a> for specific instructions about applying for the certificate.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: May I tour the IFA, visit classes, and meet faculty and students?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>Yes, we welcome visitors to the Institute. <br>
                  Contact the Academic Office at 212-992-5868 or <a href="mailto:ifa.program@nyu.edu">ifa.program@nyu.edu</a>, we can help arrange tours, meetings with faculty and students, as well as visits to classes. <br>
                  For visits to the conservation program, call 212-992-5848 or email <a href="mailto:conservation.program@nyu.edu">conservation.program@nyu.edu</a>. We would also be pleased to meet with you to answer questions you may have about your own background, goals or other special concerns.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: Is part-time study permitted at the IFA?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>The Institute currently allows part-time study for M.A. students employed in a related profession. Part-time students are expected to pursue two courses each semester. There is no part-time study in the conservation program.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: How can I obtain an application?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>You apply directly online at <a href="http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissions">http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissions</a>.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: Does the IFA have "rolling" admissions?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A:</span> No, applications for the next academic year are taken in mid-December and are not reviewed prior to that date. <br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: What is the application submission deadline?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A:</span> See the Submitting an Application page for this year’s deadline. <br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: Should I indicate a field of specialization in my application?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: Applicants to the PhD program must declare a field of specialization and a potential faculty advisor. </span>If you are an applicant to the M.A. program and you have an area of special interest, you should mention it, so that faculty appropriate to that area may read your application. For students interested in the conservation program, you will be asked at time of application your proposed area of specialty, e.g. paper, books, paintings, objects, undecided, etc<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: Should I include a writing sample with my application?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>Yes, a writing sample that demonstrates research and writing skills appropriate to graduate study in art history is required of all applicants. There is no page limit for the writing sample. <br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: How many letters of recommendation are required? Must they all be academic?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>Three letters are required, but applicants may provide others. Appropriate non-academic recommenders may certainly write on your behalf, but an application without two or three very strong letters from academic art historians is at a distinct disadvantage.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: Are GREs required? Is there a minimum score cutoff? What is the average score? How much importance is attached to the scores?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>The GRE exam is required of all applicants. There is no minimum score cutoff and we do not release score statistics. Although most successful applicants score very well in both the Verbal and Written portions, GRE scores are a single admissions indicator. Your personal statement, letters of recommendation, and academic transcripts matter as much or more.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: Is the TOEFL required of all international students?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>The TOEFL exam is required of all students whose Bachelor's degree (or its equivalent) was taught in a language other than English.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: Should I send any part of the application directly to the IFA?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A: </span>Support materials that become available after the application deadline may be sent directly to the Academic Office, Institute of Fine Arts, 1 East 78th Street, New York, NY 10075. <br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: Are interviews required for admission?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A:</span> Interviews are not required prior to submitting an application, however, <br>
                  meetings or other contact with IFA faculty members are encouraged for PhD applicants. The Academic Office can provide information about how best to contact individual faculty. <br>
                  Successful applicants to the PhD and conservation programs will be invited to interview with the admissions committees.<br>
                  <span class="strong"><br>
                  <span class="strong">Q: What is the timetable for admissions decisions?</span></span><br>
                  <span class="strong">A:</span> Applications are read throughout January and February and we invite the entering class in early March.<br>
                For the conservation program, applications are read throughout January with interview decisions being made in mid February. Interviews are held the last week of March with an invitation to join the entering class sent by mid April. Decisions by students are expected one week later.</p>
