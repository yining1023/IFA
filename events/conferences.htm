                    	<div class="expandingSubText">
                        <p class="content">Organized by Noemie Etienne, Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow, Institute of Fine Arts-NYU<br>
<br>
This one-day symposium addresses the issue of surface in paintings, but also in sculptures, architecture and the decorative arts in Europe between the 15th and 19th centuries. The focus of this reflection is an examination of how surfaces function: how do their specific properties challenge representation or the viewer? How do they determine the consumption and engagement with the object? Later variations such as graffiti, repairs, or traces of multiple hands, may also be of interest in understanding how the surface of an artwork is redefined over time.

                    	<div class="expandingSubText">
                        <p class="content">Terracottas figurines with representations of musicians are a privileged field of investigation in understanding the importance of music in both its production and performative contexts. Figurines of male and female musicians are emblematic of the close link between musical practice and the sacred and ritual spheres. They contribute not only to the reconstruction of what music and the production of music meant for ancient societies, but also provide information concerning the relationship of performance to the deities, and about which musical instruments were best suited to the particulars of diverse ritual occasions, including sacred and funerary contexts.

                    	<div class="expandingSubText">
                        <p class="content">The movement of materials beyond their source areas is an elementary feature of human social life. The history of complex material transfers can be traced as a continuous thread from today’s global commodity flows back to the prehistoric origins of our species, when exotic substances such as ochre and shell were transported over great distances to be deployed in rituals for the dead. In recent decades the empirical base from which the history of material transfers is written has undergone a significant but rarely examined transformation.

                    	<div class="expandingSubText">
                        <p class="content">Japan is widely regarded as an exemplar in terms of the preservation of material integrity, the perpetuation of historical production techniques and the responsible preservation of works of architecture and artifacts in museum contexts. The Japanese certification system for Cultural Property – which also includes the category of Living National Treasures for specialist craftsmen who embody manufacturing techniques as Intangible Cultural Property – has earned far-reaching acclaim. It is frequently overlooked, however, that there is actually a wide range of divergent approaches towards originality and authenticity even in contemporary Japan. While some of these inconsistencies find their counterparts in the West, others are related to pre-modern cultural practices, e.g. concurrent concepts of artifacts in divergent contexts of reception and evaluation.

                    	<div class="expandingSubText">
                        <p class="content">In the past few years, interest in contemporary art as a viable subject for art historical scholarship and pedagogy has substantially expanded. As increasing numbers of graduate students pursue dissertations and masters theses on the art produced in their lifetimes, many art history programs have sought to enlarge course offerings and faculty expertise in these fields. While these trends certainly reflect the growing clout of contemporary art in the marketplace and museums it may also suggest a larger shift in the discipline of art history itself.

                        <p class="content">2012 marks the hundredth year since the completion of the Duke House – originally designed for tobacco magnate, James B. Duke by the Philadelphia architect, Horace Trumbauer. In 1958, Mrs. James B. Duke and her daughter Miss Doris Duke donated the structure to New York University to house the Institute of Fine Arts. Architect Robert Venturi was charged with adapting the house for the Institute's use, which he did without altering its original architecture. 
<br><br>
The Institute has observed this anniversary with programs that explored the Duke House in the context of architecture, urbanism and the social history of New York.  On February 1-2, 2013 we will mark the close of the centennial celebrations with the conference Duke House: A Case Study in Architecture, Decoration, and Art History. The conference will consider the IFA's presence at the Duke House by looking at the building – from its commissioning by the Dukes to its eventual transformation into an educational and research facility (Friday, February 1), as well as the work and influence of some of the professors who have been its inhabitants (Saturday, February 2) – Donald Hansen, Richard Krautheimer, Erwin Panofsky, and Kirk Varnedoe. <br><br>
