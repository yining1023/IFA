     <div class="section">
      <article><p class="content">For some time I have been interested in the temporal life of artworks, which is to say how art has been handled, restored, reframed, and written about throughout the history of art. Antiquarianism, anachronism, archaism, citation, and forgery have been consistently at the focus of my work. My first book,&nbsp;<span class="italic">Michelangelo and the Reform of Art</span>&nbsp;(2000), studied that artist's engagements with older traditions, genres, and modalities of art in the context of the image debates of the sixteenth century; &nbsp;Michelangelo emerges here as an art historian of sorts before the existence of the discipline of art history. Some of these concerns were pursued in&nbsp;<span class="italic">Anachronic Renaissance&nbsp;</span>(2010), co-authored with Christopher Wood, which proposed that art of the later Middle Ages and the Renaissance developed multiple models of the relation between images and time, and that this multiplicity became a matter of reflection and commentary within art itself, as well as within the writing on art of the period. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">Throughout my work, I have been interested in how art is classified and reclassified over time, both through its practical handling and its theorization. I see the Reformation controversy over images as one massively important episode in this history of that reclassification in the West, a time when the decisions one made about these questions--What is an image? What makes a sacred image sacred? What is its relation to secular art?--were a matter of life and death. My book&nbsp;<span class="italic">The Controversy of Renaissance Art</span>&nbsp;(2011) was an effort to investigate how much Italian art was involved in these debates, an overlooked history in part because the Italian works look so very different from what we see in the Protestant North, and also because the later coming of the Counter Reformation had suppressed this earlier history of Italian sympathies with Reformation ideals. This material got me fairly deeply involved in questions of image magic, esotericism in the arts, and the history of heresy.</p>
      <p class="content">When looking at past relations to the history of art, I have always followed the artists as much as the writers. In<span class="italic">Medieval Modern: Art out of Time</span>&nbsp;(2012), I traced the presence and power of medieval art for twentieth-century artists, arguing that it was integral to many of the major developments in the art of that century. Here, too, the artists practice a form of art history, and sometimes were themselves in active dialogue with the historians of medieval art, from Wilhelm Worringer to Meyer Schapiro to Leo Steinberg.</p>
      <p class="content">Most recently, my work has turned to the question of orientation in Renaissance art. How do art works serve as means by which to orient oneself in the world? To try to answer this question for the art of the later Middle Ages and the Renaissance in the West is to open oneself to a world in which Europe was not at the center of the world but rather was looking eastward for its values, its image traditions, its sacred geography, as well as for its mythical origins. Art during the early Renaissance was "oriented," looking eastward from specific local circumstances and knitting local concerns with information reported from far-flung places. A whole new conception of image-making, with painting as the superintendent art, emerged in order to manage the many mediations structuring these local-global relations. Later, beginning in the sixteenth century, it developed a Europe-centered view, configuring itself as regional and national, a more familiar conception that grounded the later history of art in the West and threw into shadow the earlier world-view.     </p>
