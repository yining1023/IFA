In 2014-2015 we will welcome our fourth
honorary fellow <span class="strong">Leonard Barkan</span>, Class of
1943 University Professor and Chair of the
Department of Comparative Literature at
Princeton University. He has been a professor
of English and of Art History at various universities
including Northwestern, Michigan,
and NYU. Among his books are The Gods
Made Flesh: Metamorphosis and the Pursuit of
Paganism, Transuming Passion: Ganymede and
the Erotics of Humanism, and Unearthing the
Past: Archaeology and Aesthetics in the Making
of Renaissance Culture, which won prizes from
the Modern Language Association, the College
Art Association, the American Comparative
Literature Association, Phi Beta Kappa,
and the PEN America Center. He is the
winner of the Morton Dauwen Zabel Award
from the American Academy of Arts and
Letters. He has been an actor and a director;
he is also a regular contributor to publications
in both the U.S. and Italy, where he writes
on the subject of food and wine. In 2006, he
published Satyr Square, which is an account
of art, literature, food, wine, Italy, and himself.
Recent publications include Michelangelo on
Paper, recording the life of the artist via the
sheets of paper on which he both wrote and
drew, and Mute Poetry, Speaking Pictures, a
study of the relations among words, images,
and pleasure from Plato to the Renaissance.
He is currently writing a book about the relations
between food culture and high culture
from antiquity to the Renaissance and another,
not so scholarly book about his love for
the city of Berlin. At Princeton, he has taught
courses on subjects including Shakespeare,
Michelangelo, Narcissus, Word and Image,
and Comedy.</p>

<p class="content">In 2013-2014, we will welcome our third Honorary Fellow <span class="strong">Irene J. Winter</span>, William Dorr Boardman Professor of Fine Arts Emerita in the Department of History of Art and Architecture at Harvard University.  Professor Winter is a preeminent scholar of Ancient Near Eastern studies. She received a B.A. in Anthropology from Barnard College, an M.A. from the University of Chicago in Oriental Languages and Literature, and a PhD in Art History and Archaeology from Columbia University after completing a dissertation on ivory carvings from northern Syria in the early first millennium BCE. She taught at Queens College in New York and the University of Pennsylvania prior to joining the faculty at Harvard University. She was Slade Professor at Cambridge University in 1997, and delivered the Mellon lectures at the National Gallery/CASVA in 2005.  In recent years, she served on the Iraq Task Force of the Archaeological Institute of America, contributing to ongoing efforts to recover and restore looted objects and protect the region’s cultural heritage. Her fieldwork as an archaeologist has been mainly in Iran from 1967 to 1974, and most recently in Iraq in the winter of 2011-12.  An essayist by disposition, Professor Winter has authored numerous articles regarded as highly influential in her field, many of which were collected into two volumes and published by Brill in 2010. A book based upon the Mellon lectures is currently in progress. </p>

<p class="content">In 2012-2013, we will welcome our second Honorary Fellow Ann Temkin, the Marie-Josée and Henry Kravis Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, New York.  Dr. Temkin received a B.A. from Harvard University and a PhD in the History of Art from Yale University. She first worked at the MoMA from 1984 to 1987 as a curatorial assistant in the painting and sculpture department. In 1990, she accepted the position of curator of modern and contemporary art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where she worked until her return to the Modern’s painting and sculpture department in 2003. Upon the retirement of her predecessor John Elderfield in 2008, Dr. Temkin assumed the role of Chief Curator of painting and sculpture at the museum. Her research is focused mostly on postwar and contemporary art, with past exhibitions surveying artists Joseph Beuys, Sherrie Levine, Alice Neel, Barnett Newman, Gabriel Orozco, and Raymond Pettibon, among others. She recently curated a major exhibition on abstract expressionism in New York, culled entirely from the MoMA’s collection.</p>
