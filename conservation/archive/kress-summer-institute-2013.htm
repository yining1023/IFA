                What multiple meanings might be teased from the word <span class="italic">structure?  </span>An art historian may reference the compositional elements in a work of art, or frame the concept in the sense of late 20th-century Post-structuralist theory, with a look to the systems of knowledge embedded within the object. A conservator, on the other hand, anchors herself within the physicality of the work of art in order to consider the material support below the object&rsquo;s visible surface. At the same time, a materials scientist looks through the perceived form of the work, to better grasp physical and chemical interactions at an atomic level. And yet, we might ask, are these various approaches necessarily at odds? What are the relationships between material and formal structures, between structure and artistic choice? And how might the structures of art be used as an effective course concept in art history departments? </p>
              <p class="content">The fourth annual <span class="strong">Summer Teachers Institute in Technical Art History</span> (STITAH), <span class="italic">The Structures of Art</span>, will address these issues and more, in the context of a five-day course devoted to the material structure in works of art.  Made possible through the generous support of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, this intensive seminar will be held at the Conservation Center, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, and at local museums/galleries, from July 21-25, 2014.    The STITAH presents a multi-faceted approach to the topic, including direct instruction, discussion, practical workshops and hands-on activities, with case studies drawn from collections in and around New York City.  Faculty will include conservators, scientists, architects and historic preservation specialists from both New York area institutions as well as guest lecturers from across the U.S. and abroad. Study units will move from a focus on paintings, to paper, sculpture, and finally buildings and large-scale monuments.  A final program will be posted once available.</p>
              <p class="content">Participating professors will be encouraged to explore and, in turn, receive guidance in creative ways of integrating technical art history into their own classes, whether introductory undergraduate courses or courses at the more advanced undergraduate and graduate level.  The Institute will provide relevant course readings and reading lists, and other curricular materials, for use in the participants&rsquo; own teaching and research.  </p>
              <p class="content"><span class="italic">Is it for you?</span></p>
              <p class="content">Full-time art history faculty at North American colleges and universities are eligible to apply.  No background in science or conservation is required.  Consideration will be given to dual applications from an art history professor and a science professor who teach collaboratively at the same institution.  No more than fifteen faculty members will be admitted to the program, and applicants will be evaluated based largely on their expressed commitment to integrating technical art history into their own teaching curricula.  </p>

              <p class="content">Thanks to the generous support of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, participating faculty will receive hotel accommodation at New York University as well as a $600 stipend to help defray travel and other associated costs.               </p>

</span>What is a brush stroke?&nbsp; What can it tell us?&nbsp; What pigments and paint media did the &ldquo;old masters&rdquo; choose ... and why?&nbsp; How can technical analysis help us to discover the process of creation, the relationships between artists and workshops, and the changes wrought on paintings over time?<br>
<br>
As summarized by David Bomford, Acting Director, J. Paul Getty Museum, &ldquo;technical art history concerns itself with all the processes for making art, and the technical and documentary means by which we throw light on those processes.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup><br>
<br>
The Summer Teachers Institute in Technical Art History (STITAH), hosted by the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, in partnership with the University Art Gallery, Yale University, offered a unique professional development opportunity for professors of art history in colleges and universities who wished to enrich their own teaching with the insights gleaned through technical art history.&nbsp; The program was an overwhelming success.&nbsp; A total of 15 participants joined us, 13 art historians and 2 scientists, all from various teaching institutions across the U.S. &nbsp;and Canada. With lectures, gallery tours, conservation labs visits and more, the group enjoyed learning from experts who traveled from near (the Conservation Center and the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and far (National Gallery of Art, and the National Gallery, London).&nbsp; There was even a chance for everyone to get their hands dirty, with a practical workshop on Old Master Artists&rsquo; techniques led by Phoebe Dent Weil.</p>
