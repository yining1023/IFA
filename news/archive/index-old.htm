  Recent excavations in Aphrodisias (Aug 2012), one of the most important archaeological sites in modern Turkey, directed by <a href="http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/RRS.html">R.R.R. Smith</a>&nbsp;with <a href="mailto:%20as7085@nyu.edu">A. Sokolicek</a> and <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/faculty/welch.htm">K. Welch</a>, have revealed two life-size marble statues, both of high quality. They were found built into the foundations of a post-antique or early medieval building and are in a very good state of preservation. The find has also been announced in the <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/headless-statues-unearthed-in-aphrodisias-excavations.aspx?pageID=238&nID=29194&NewsCatID=375" target="_blank">Turkish media (click here for the article)</a>. One of the figures wears Greek civilian dress (tunic and cloak) and is of mid-imperial date, c. AD 200. He is displayed in a dynamic posture, holding a book scroll in his left hand. The other figure wears a late antique Roman toga and is of the fifth century AD. It has a stolid four-square posture, a thick chest, and an unusually fat belly. The second statue probably represented a governor or other high-ranking office-holder in the imperial administration. The discoveries are described in more detail in <a href="http://www.livescience.com/23267-headless-roman-statues-discovered.html" target="_blank">this interview</a> of R.R.R.
